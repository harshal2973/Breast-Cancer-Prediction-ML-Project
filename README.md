#### > Deploy on Cloud and make this wonderful project available to public

## About Project:

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. When cancers are found early, they can often be cured. 
Some devices detect breast cancer but many times they lead to false positives, which results 
in patients undergoing painful, expensive surgeries that were not even necessary. These type of cancers are called 
**benign** which do not require surgeries and we can reduce these unnecessary surgeries by using Machine Learning. 
I have taken the dataset of the previous breast cancer patients and train the model to predict whether the cancer is **benign** or **malignant**. These predictions will help doctors to do surgeries only when the cancer is malignant, thus reducing the unnecessary surgeries for women. 
 
For building the project I have used Wisconsin Breast cancer data which has 569 rows of which 357 are benign and 212 are malignant. 
The data is prepossessed and scaled. I have trained with Random forest Classifier gives the best accuracy of 95.0%. To provide an easy-to-use interface to doctors I have developed a website that will take the data and display the output with accuracy and time taken to predict.
